# filter-3-channeled-grayscale-images
In search for a better method to distinguish RGB images that look more like grayscale images from its true colorful fellows.

My motivation behind this is to clean the UTKFace dataset, tailor it to my need. The jupyter notebook `investigate-UTKFace-grey.ipynb` targets the UTKFace dataset, which can be downloaded, for example, [from kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/jangedoo/utkface-new/version/1). (Or you might be able to apply the same jupyter notebook on any other image datasets that contain grayscale-like RGB images.)

Note that the user might have to modify the paths inside the jupyter notebook to have it suit for their own computer's directory tree.
