# filter-3-channeled-grayscale-images
In search for a better method to distinguish RGB images that look more like grayscale from its true colorful fellows

My motivation behind this repo is to clean the UTKFace dataset, tailor it to my need. Besides, there are indeed a few bad, noisy images inside this dataset. Here, we search only to distinguish grayscale 3-channeled images from color images. And the jupyter notebook targets the UTKFace dataset, which can be downloaded, for example, [from kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/jangedoo/utkface-new/version/1). (Or you might be able to apply it on any other image dataset you want.)

Note that the user might have to modify the paths inside the jupyter notebook to have it suit for their own computer's directory tree.
